## EER stands for **Enhanced Entity Relationship**

### What is an EER diagram?

**Enhanced entity-relationship (EER)** diagrams are basically an expanded upon version of ER diagrams. EER models are helpful tools for designing databases with high-level models. With their enhanced features, you can plan databases more thoroughly by delving into the properties and constraints with more precision.

An EER diagram provides you with all the elements of an ER diagram while adding:

* Attribute or relationship inheritances
* Category or union types
* Specialization and generalization
* Subclasses and superclasses

Overall, an EER diagram builds off of an ER diagram by including elements that allow for aggregating, generalizing, and specializing.
